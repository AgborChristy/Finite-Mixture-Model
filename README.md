# Finite-Mixture-Model
This study aims to analyze the headache frequency data using a finite mixture model and to explore potential clusters in the data while considering the patient's age as a covariate.
The analysis involves fitting a mixture distribution to the data and investigating relationships between identified clusters and patients' age. This approach offers insights into headache patterns and their potential associations.
The application of the mixture model reveals distinct components in the data, shedding light on different headache frequency clusters. An association between age and clusters is observed, though other factors also contribute to cluster presence.
The study demonstrates the utility of finite mixture models in understanding headache frequency patterns. Age plays a role in cluster formation, but additional factors should be considered to fully explain cluster presence. This approach contributes to a comprehensive understanding of headache treatment strategies.
